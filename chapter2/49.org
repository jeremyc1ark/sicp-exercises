#+TITLE: Exercise 2.49
Use `segments->painter' to define the following primitive
painters:

* Part A
The painter that draws the outline of the designated frame.

#+header: :eval "no"
#+begin_src scheme
(define part-a
  (segments->painter
   (list (make-segment (make-vect 0 0)
                       (make-vect 0 1))
         (make-segment (make-vect 0 0)
                       (make-vect 1 0))
         (make-segment (make-vect 1 1)
                       (make-vect 1 0))
         (make-segment (make-vect 1 1)
                       (make-vect 0 1)))))
#+end_src

* Part B
The painter that draws an "X" by connecting opposite corners of
the frame.

#+header: :eval "no"
#+begin_src scheme
(define part-b
  (segments->painter (list (make-segment (make-vect 0 0)
                                        (make-vect 1 1))
                          (make-segment (make-vect 1 0)
                                        (make-vect 0 1)))))
#+end_src

* Part C
The painter that draws a diamond shape by connecting the
midpoints of the sides of the frame.

#+header: :eval "no"
#+begin_src scheme
(define part-c
  (segments->painter (list (make-segment (make-vect 0 0.5)
                                         (make-vect 0.5 1))
                           (make-segment (make-vect 0 0.5)
                                         (make-vect 0.5 0))
                           (make-segment (make-vect 0.5 0)
                                         (make-vect 1 0.5))
                           (make-segment (make-vect 1 0.5)
                                         (make-vect 0.5 1)))))
#+end_src

* Part D
The ~wave~ painter.

This one is a waste of my time. I am not doing it. I will spend
my time doing something more productive and challenging.
