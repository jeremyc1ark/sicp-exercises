*Exercise 1.13:* Prove that _Fib_(n) is the closest integer to
[phi]^n/[sqrt](5), where [phi] = (1 + [sqrt](5))/2.  Hint: Let
[fork] = (1 - [sqrt](5))/2.  Use induction and the
definition of the Fibonacci numbers (see section *Note 1-2-2::) to
prove that _Fib_(n) = ([phi]^n - [fork]^n)/[sqrt](5).

The definition of fib, assuming n != 0 is:
fib(n) = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

Let's rename [phi] to p and [fork] to z just to make things more
legible. We want to prove that fib(n) = (p^n - z^n)/sqrt(5).
Using the definition of fib, we can set try to do this:

(p^n - z^n)/sqrt(5) = (p^(n-1) - z^(n-1))/sqrt(5) + (p^(n-2) - z^(n-2))/sqrt(5)
