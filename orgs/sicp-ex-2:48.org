#+TITLE: Exercise 2.48
A directed line segment in the plane can be represented as a pair
of vectors--the vector running from the origin to the start-point
of the segment, and the vector running from the origin to the
end-point of the segment. Use your vector representation from
*Note Exercise 2-46:: to define a representation for segments
with a constructor `make-segment' and selectors `start-segment'
and `end-segment'.

One does not actually need the vector representation to implement
these procedures. This is one of the great things about
abstractions; one can build off of more primitive data structures
without explicitly referencing their constructors or selectors.
This is an example of an abstraction barrier.
