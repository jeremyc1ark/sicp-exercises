#+TITLE: Exercise 2.52
Make changes to the square limit of `wave' shown in *Note Figure
2-9:: by working at each of the levels described above. In
particular:

* Part A
Add some segments to the primitive `wave' painter of *Note
Exercise 2-49:: (to add a smile, for example).

See Exercise 2.49. I believe that "drawing" trivial shapes using
a coordinate system is a waste of time. I will spend my time
doing something more productive.

* Part B
Change the pattern constructed by `corner-split' (for example, by
using only one copy of the `up-split' and `right-split' images
instead of two).

#+header: :eval "no"
#+begin_src scheme
(define (corner-split painter n)
  (if (= n 0)
      painter
      (let* ([up (up-split painter (- n 1))]
             [right (right-split painter (- n 1))]
             [corner (corner-split painter (- n 1))])
          (beside (below painter up)
                  (below right corner)))))
#+end_src

* Part C
Modify the version of `square-limit' that uses `square-of-four'
so as to assemble the corners in a different pattern.  (For
example, you might make the big Mr. Rogers look outward from each
corner of the square.)

#+header: :eval "no"
#+begin_src scheme
(define (square-limit painter n)
  (let ((combine4 (square-of-four identity flip-horiz
                                  rotate180 flip-vert)))
    (combine4 (corner-split painter n))))
#+end_src
