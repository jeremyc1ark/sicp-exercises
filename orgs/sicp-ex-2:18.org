*Exercise 2.18:* Define a procedure `reverse' that takes a list as
argument and returns a list of the same elements in reverse order:

  (reverse (list 1 4 9 16 25))
  (25 16 9 4 1)

#+header: :eval "no"
#+begin_src scheme
  (define (reverse lat [new-lat null])
    (if (null? lat)
        new-lat
        (reverse (cdr lat) (cons (car lat) new-lat))))

  (reverse (list 1 4 9 16 25))
#+end_src

I am not evaluating this because for some reason org-mode is
being glitchy. This code works as expected in a regular Racket
REPL, but for some reason it does not work in org-mode Babel.
This is a correct solution to the problem though.
