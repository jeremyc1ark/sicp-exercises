*Exercise 2.24:* Suppose we evaluate the expression `(list 1 (list
2 (list 3 4)))'.  Give the result printed by the interpreter, the
corresponding box-and-pointer structure, and the interpretation of
this as a tree (as in *Note Figure 2-6::).

Here is the box-and-pointer structure:
[[../imgs/box_rep.png]]

Here is the tree representation:
[[../imgs/tree_rep.png]]

The result printed by the interpreter will be ~(1 2 (3 4))~.
