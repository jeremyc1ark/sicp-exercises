*Exercise 2.84:* Using the `raise' operation of *Note Exercise
2-83::, modify the `apply-generic' procedure so that it coerces
its arguments to have the same type by the method of successive
raising, as discussed in this section.  You will need to devise a
way to test which of two types is higher in the tower.  Do this in
a manner that is "compatible" with the rest of the system and will
not lead to problems in adding new levels to the tower.

I have already implemented this method in the form of ~coerce-arg~ from Exercise 2.82.

#+begin_src scheme :results silent
(define (coerce-arg arg type)
  (let ((current-type (type-tag arg)))
    (if (equal? current-type type)
        arg
        (coerce-arg ((get-level-proc current-type) arg)
                    type))))
#+end_src

See Exercise 2.82 for full implementation in ~apply-generic~.
