*Exercise 2.8:* Using reasoning analogous to Alyssa's, describe
how the difference of two intervals may be computed.  Define a
corresponding subtraction procedure, called `sub-interval'.

The minimum value the difference could be is the lower bound of
the minuend minus the upper bound of the subrahend. The maximum
value the difference could be is the upper bound of the minuend
minus the lower bound of the subtrahend.
